# Weather and Air Quality App

See the deployed application here: [https://example.com](https://example.com)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This application, built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, provides weather, air quality, and UV index data for U.S. locations using the following public APIs:

- **National Weather Service API** for weather data.
- **EPA AirNow API** for air quality data.
- **EPA UV Index API** for UV index data.

The app includes a search bar that allows users to input their desired U.S. location and receive up-to-date information. Please note:

- The National Weather Service API is only available for U.S. locations.
- The APIs may occasionally return errors due to service availability.

The app is fully responsive, working across desktop and mobile devices.
